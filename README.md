<h1>INTLS</h1>
<p>INTLS is an injectable minecraft utility</p>
<p>I made it for fun and it will work best on 1.8.9</p>


[Download Injector](https://github.com/1hyzh/INTLS_Injector/releases/tag/0.5)

The main window should look like this:

After you enabled the modules it should output this in the console:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53c5994d-aba0-4df3-ad7e-fcd515797554)

âš If you get this error:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44997a65-2223-42a6-be31-4865c30c77f6)

Or anything that says failed to get Minecraft Class...

then RightClickDelay0 won't work and it will crash the game when enabled.
